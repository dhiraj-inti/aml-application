# aml-application architecture

Behold a paradigm of secure, intelligent, and compliant transactional architecture. This ecosystem is engineered to seamlessly integrate predictive analytics with the immutable trust of a decentralized ledger.

At the genesis of the workflow, we have the **Client App**, which serves as the primary ingress point for user-initiated actions. The data payload, designated as **INPUT**, does not enter our core system directly. Instead, it is first channeled through a crucial **Oracle Service**. This service acts as a trusted conduit, ensuring that external data is reliably and securely brought on-chain for processing.

The verified data then arrives at the very nexus of our design: the **AML Service**. This is the central adjudication engine where the transaction undergoes rigorous scrutiny. The AML Service orchestrates a sophisticated dialogue with our predictive intelligence layer, the **Statistical Model**. This model generates advanced **PREDICTIONS** concerning the transaction's potential risk profile. These predictive insights are then synthesized and quantified by the **Risk Scoring and Reporting** module, which furnishes the AML service with a clear, data-driven assessment.

The culmination of this analysis leads to the critical decision gateway: the **"Flagged?"** bifurcation point. Here, the transaction's path is determined based on its computed risk score.

- **The Path of Escalation:** Should the transaction be deemed anomalous or high-risk, the **YES** vector is triggered. This initiates the generation of a comprehensive **Forensic Report**, creating an immutable dossier of evidence for further investigation by compliance officers and regulatory bodies.
- **The Path of Validation:** Conversely, if the transaction is cleared as legitimate, the **NO** vector is followed. The transaction is then committed to the **Blockchain Storage**. We leverage the powerful and interoperable **Cosmos SDK** to memorialize the transaction on a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger, ensuring ultimate transparency and finality.

In essence, this architecture represents a harmonious fusion of proactive risk mitigation and decentralized trust. It is a self-governing framework that validates legitimate operations with cryptographic certainty while meticulously isolating and documenting suspicious activities, thereby forging a new standard in operational integrity.
